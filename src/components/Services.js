            Roger Poitras' method of instruction is a combination of several disciplines:
            <ul>
              <li>The Alexander Technique</li>
              <li>Soma Neuromuscular Integration</li>
              <li>The Feldenkrais Method</li>
              <li>Centered Riding</li> 
            </ul>
            These disciplines have been brought together into the following elements: 
            <ul>
              <li>Hands-on body work to aid the rider in awareness of tensions in the body and in releasing those tensions.</li>
              <li>Body alignment for proper balance.</li>
              <li>Flow of energy in the development of form and movement.</li>
              <li>Visualization for freedom of mind and body.</li> 
            </ul>
            The resulting effect is the body understanding, energizing and communicating with great clarity.
